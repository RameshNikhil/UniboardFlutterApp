## About 
Uniboard is the most intuitive, beautiful and easy way to use moodle. We saw the problems of the current university moodle systems, namely; the inefficient format which takes students much longer to navigate to content from than required, a lack of features such as searching and a download all capability and an overall unfriendly interface. 

With uniboard we learnt from the mistakes of moodle and developed an interface that does right what the current moodle doesn't. To learn more or try it search: [Uniboard.app]

## Progress 
Slightly tainted progress of the Uniboard mobile application built in flutter. 
Note: Both Sameer and I are very tight on time so if you'd like to contribute, please feel free to fork and build off what we've currently got.
